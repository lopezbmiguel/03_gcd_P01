#Code Book for "tidy_data.txt"

The file "tidy_data" contains:

A dataset with 11800 observations and 3 variables and 1 measure.

The variables are defined as follows:

1. Activity: The activity the subject performed for each experiment.

Levels:
"LAYING"
"SITTING"
"STANDING"
"WALKING"
"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"

2. Subject: The identifier for the subject that performed the activity.

Levels:
From 1 to 30

3. Variable: The variable measured during each activity.

Each variable represents a measurement taken by the accelerometer or the gyroscope of the device during
each activity.

The naming convention for each variable is as follows:
Position 1. Levels: Frequency, Time. Describes whether the measure was made in the frequency or time domains.
Position 2. Levels: Body, Gravity. Describes whether the measure represents the acceleration of the body, or the acceleration induced by gravity.
Position 3. Levels: Accelerometer, Gyroscope. Specifies if the measure was recorded by the Accelerometer or the Gyroscope.
Position 4. Levels: Jerk, Magnitude, not present. Specifies whether the measure is a derivative in time (Jerk), the magnitude of the signal combining al axes X,Y,Z (Magnitude), or the magnitude of the signal on each axis (not present).
Position 5. Levels: Mean, StDeviation. Describes whether the measure for each window sample is the mean or the standard deviation of the measures taken during the sample window.
Position 6. Levels: X,Y,Z, not present. Indicates whether the measurmenet is a portion of the signal on a particular axis (X,Y,Z) or the magnitude of the signal with all the axis combined (not present).
